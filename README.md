This repo contains the code to reproduce the simulation results in the report.

It implements an efficient MM algorithm to solve a non-convex optimization problem approximately.

How to use the code:
1) Download MM_demo.m and MM_Phi_hist.m in the same folder
2) Set the simulation parameters (M, K, snr, rho) in MM_demo.m script
3) Run MM_demo.m script
