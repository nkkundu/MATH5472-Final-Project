# MATH5472-Final-Project
This repo contains the implementation of MM Algorithm.
Project Name: Majorization-Minimization Algorithms in Signal Processing, Communications, and Machine Learning
By: Neel Kanth KUNDU (20525393)
This repo contains the code to reproduce the simulation results in the report.
It implements an efficient MM algorithm to solve a non-convex optimization problem approximately.

How to use the code:
1) Modify the simulation parameters (M, K, snr, rho) in MM_demo.m
2) Run MM_demo.m
